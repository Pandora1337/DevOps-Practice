# GitHub Pages Deployment with Actions

This project aims to demonstrate my knowledge of GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to Pages.
Deploy action will only push `index.html`, and will be triggered after every push that changes the `index.html`

The site should be accessible on [https://pandora1337.github.io/gh-actions-deployment-workflow](https://pandora1337.github.io/DevOps-Practice/gh-actions-deployment-workflow/)
